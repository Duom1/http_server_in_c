# http server in c

I wanted to learn more about lowlevel networking and other
features like threading and stuff. And i think this
project has taught me exactly those things. And also
this thing is definitely not safe and propably contains
alot of bugs and vulnerabilities.

## issues

no proper mutex or atomics

## what i would do differently ?

- better planning.
- better error checking from the start instead of writing stuff
  and then later trying to add that
- i should have used some cross platforn threading lib
- i should have used cmake instead of using my own python script
